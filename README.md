# üéæ ATP Men's Tennis Matches (1968‚Äì2022) ‚Äî Exploratory Data Analysis

## üìë Overview
This repository contains the Python code, datasets, and visualizations for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of ATP men's tennis matches from **1968 to 2022**.
The analysis was conducted as part of a data analytics academic assignment, aiming to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships in tennis performance data.

Key areas of exploration include:
- Match duration across surfaces (clay, grass, hard, carpet)
- Serve performance metrics (aces, double faults)
- Player attributes (age, height, ranking)
- Outlier detection and handling
- Correlation and trend analysis
